 * The LoaderContainer class is used to load SWF files or image(JPG, PNG, or GIF)
 * files. Use the <code>load()</code> method to initiate loading. The loaded
 * display object is added as a child of the LoaderContainer object.
 *
 * <p>Use the URLLoader class to load text or binary data.</p>
 *
 * <p>The LoaderContainer class overrides the following methods that it inherits,
 * because a LoaderContainer object can only have one child display object - the
 * display object that it loads. Calling the following methods throws an
 * exception: <code>addChild()</code>, <code>addChildAt()</code>,
 * <code>removeChild()</code>, <code>removeChildAt()</code>, and
 * <code>setChildIndex()</code>. To remove a loaded display object, you must
 * remove the <i>LoaderContainer</i> object from its parent DisplayObjectContainer
 * child array. </p>
 *
 * <p><b>Note:</b> The ActionScript 2.0 MovieClipLoader and LoadVars classes
 * are not used in ActionScript 3.0. The LoaderContainer and URLLoader classes replace
 * them.</p>
 *
 * <p>When you use the LoaderContainer class, consider the Flash Player and Adobe AIR
 * security model: </p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>You can load content from any accessible source. </li>
 *   <li>Loading is not allowed if the calling SWF file is in a network
 * sandbox and the file to be loaded is local. </li>
 *   <li>If the loaded content is a SWF file written with ActionScript 3.0, it
 * cannot be cross-scripted by a SWF file in another security sandbox unless
 * that cross-scripting arrangement was approved through a call to the
 * <code>System.allowDomain()</code> or the
 * <code>System.allowInsecureDomain()</code> method in the loaded content
 * file.</li>
 *   <li>If the loaded content is an AVM1 SWF file(written using ActionScript
 * 1.0 or 2.0), it cannot be cross-scripted by an AVM2 SWF file(written using
 * ActionScript 3.0). However, you can communicate between the two SWF files
 * by using the LocalConnection class.</li>
 *   <li>If the loaded content is an image, its data cannot be accessed by a
 * SWF file outside of the security sandbox, unless the domain of that SWF
 * file was included in a URL policy file at the origin domain of the
 * image.</li>
 *   <li>Movie clips in the local-with-file-system sandbox cannot script movie
 * clips in the local-with-networking sandbox, and the reverse is also
 * prevented. </li>
 *   <li>You cannot connect to commonly reserved ports. For a complete list of
 * blocked ports, see "Restricting Networking APIs" in the <i>ActionScript 3.0
 * Developer's Guide</i>. </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>However, in AIR, content in the <code>application</code> security
 * sandbox(content installed with the AIR application) are not restricted by
 * these security limitations.</p>

 * <p>When loading a SWF file from an untrusted source(such as a domain other
 * than that of the LoaderContainer object's root SWF file), you may want to define a

 * of the LoaderContainer object) from drawing to portions of the Stage outside of that
 * mask, as shown in the following code:</p>

	 *   <li>The <code>complete</code> event is dispatched when a file completes

	 * available. </li>
	 *   <li>The <code>init</code> event is dispatched after the properties and

	 * Removes a child of this Loader object that was loaded by using the

	 * <p>As a best practice, before you unload a child SWF file, you should

	 * LocalConnection, NetConnection, NetStream, and Sound objects. Otherwise,
	 * audio in the child SWF file might continue to play, even though the child
	 * SWF file was unloaded. To close streams in the child SWF file, add an
	 * event listener to the child that listens for the <code>unload</code>
	 * event. When the parent calls <code>Loader.unload()</code>, the
	 * <code>unload</code> event is dispatched to the child. The following code
	 * shows how you might do this:</p>
	 * <pre xml:space="preserve"> public closeAllStreams(evt:Event) {
	 * myNetStream.close(); mySound.close(); myNetConnection.close();
	 * myLocalConnection.close(); }
